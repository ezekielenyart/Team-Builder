# Team-Builder

In this command line application, a manager is able to create a team roster through the command line interface. It will then dynamically render to an HTML page with the appropriate information for each person populated with your answers.  Each person has an input field for their name, ID, and their email.  Additionally, if they are an Engineer, they have an input for the GitHub page, Managers have an input field for their office number, and Interns have a field for their School.  

It is still being completed, as I didn't have enough time to complete it before the deadline.
